'I get the feeling that this generation just wants to have a bit of fun and the more you encourage them to be themselves and express themselves, the more banter and energy comes out,' Still says.</p><p>Among his key weapons? Ultra-competitive training. 'In any game we play, there are points,' Still says. </p><p>At the end of every month, whoever sits bottom of the squad's league table must buy everyone a meal.

Often there is great merit in those discussions and occasionally there is a legal necessity, too.</p><p>But other times, and all journalists know this, it becomes a forum for the subject of enquiries to limit legitimate reporting. To muffle. To use those informal, background briefings to soften the edges of a story without putting a fingerprint on it.</p><p>Those exchanges can be valuable and informative, and there are many excellent, honest operators at many clubs, but anyone who believes full transparency is forthcoming in such conversations has a remarkable generosity of spirit. They will see presents under the tree this month and see only magic.</p><p>United’s truth is not one of an organisation that has been hounded and criticised beyond reasonable boundaries. Their truth is that this season has quickly unravelled into a shambles of their own making, factoring in the flip-flopping of the Mason Greenwood saga, the Jadon Sancho mutiny, the immovability of the Glazers and the dross we have seen on the field.</p>"

But Israel paid no heed to Washington, as it continued with its bloody new phase of the war. </p><p>Indeed, Gaza health officials said many civilians were killed in an Israeli strike on houses in Deir al-Balah, north of Khan Younis. Dr Eyad Al-Jabri, head of the Shuhada Al-Aqsa Hospital there, told Reuters at least 45 people were killed. Reuters could not reach the area nor confirm the toll. </p><p>Meanwhile, areas in the central and northern Gaza Strip were still coming under bombardment on Wednesday, according to Hamas.</p><p>The Hamas-run health ministry said air strikes on the Nuseirat refugee camp in central Gaza killed six people and injured 14 others.</p><p>Israel had previously told civilians in the north of the densely populated Gaza Strip to seek shelter in the south of the territory, with many fleeing to Khan Yunis believing it would be safer.</p><p>As the war expands, Israel has told people to move even further south, sparking 'panic, fear and anxiety', according to Philippe Lazzarini, head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA.</p><p>People were being pushed into an area that is less than one-third of the Gaza Strip, with roads to the south clogged, he said.</p><p>International aid groups have condemned the succession of orders to flee from one area to another, saying that civilians were running out of options.</p><p>'Nowhere is safe in Gaza,' said United Nations humanitarian chief Martin Griffiths. 'Not hospital, not shelters, not refugee camps. No one is safe.'</p><p>Following demands to create areas where civilians could shelter, Israel's army published a map it said was intended to enable Gazans to 'evacuate from specific places for their safety if required'.</p><p>But the UN criticised the map on Tuesday, saying it was impossible to create safe zones for civilians to flee to inside Gaza.</p><p>'The so-called safe zones... are not scientific, they are not rational, they are not possible, and I think the authorities are aware of this,' said James Elder, spokesman for the UN children's agency UNICEF.</p><p>At Khan Younis' main Nasser hospital, the wounded arrived by ambulance, car, flatbed truck and donkey cart after what survivors described as a strike on a school being used as a shelter for the displaced.</p><p>Inside a ward, almost every inch of blood-splattered floor space was taken up by the wounded including small children, with medics hurrying from patient to patient while relatives wailed.</p><p>Two girls were being treated, still covered in dust from the collapse of the house that had buried their family.</p><p>'My parents are under the rubble,' sobbed one child. 'I want my mum, I want my mum, I want my family.'</p><p>The violence in Gaza 'now ranks amongst the worst assaults on any civilian population in our time and age', according to the Norwegian Refugee Council, which also warned of the dire public health consequences of the approaching winter.</p><p>Their belongings piled onto donkey carts, battered vehicles and camels, Gazans headed south to try to escape the expanding Israeli offensive.</p><p>An estimated 1.9 million people are displaced in Gaza - roughly three-quarters of the population, according to UN figures.</p><p>Amid continued international criticism of Gaza's plight, the United States, Israel's close ally, reiterated on Tuesday that Israel needed to do more to allow fuel and other aid into Gaza and reduce harm to civilians.</p><p>'The level of assistance that's getting in is not sufficient,' U.S. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said at a press briefing. 'It needs to go up, and we've made that clear to the government of Israel.' </p>"

Clarke, director of research at The Soufan Group, a global intelligence and security consulting firm. </p><p>Its tactics included suicide bombings and shootings of Israeli soldiers and civilians.</p><p>On Tuesday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and members of his war cabinet held a tense and emotional meeting with recently released hostages and family members of hostages still held in Gaza.</p><p>Some of the recently released hostages shared testimonies of sexual abuse during their time in Gaza, participants said.</p><p>Separately, a doctor who treated some of the 110 released hostages told the AP that at least 10 men and women among those freed were sexually assaulted or abused, but did not provide further details. </p><p>He spoke on condition of anonymity to protect the hostages' identities.</p><p>According to the Israeli military, 138 hostages, including 15 women, are still held by Hamas and other terror or militant groups in Gaza.</p><p>Lt. Col. Richard Hecht, a military spokesman, said the army is 'absolutely' concerned about sexual violence against female hostages.    </p><p>On Monday, Israel hosted a special event at the United Nations, where former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, US Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand and top technology executive Sheryl Sandberg were among those who criticised what they called a global failure to support women who were sexually assaulted and killed.</p><p>But some groups say Israel isn't making it easy to investigate.</p><p>The Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights said it requested access to Israel and the Palestinian territories to allow it to collect information from the events that took place on Oct. 7 and 8, and since then.</p>"

And that was the that was the problem.</p><p>The inquiry was shown an email from Mr Johnson's then-private secretary Imran Shafi, who wrote on February 24 2020: 'At some point soon, I'd like to start exposing the PM to the potential decisions he might have to take in short order on this – at the moment it's been fairly abstract with him I think'.</p><p>Asked what his general level of knowledge was at this point, Mr Johnson said: 'My memory now is that the scenes from Italy really rattled me.</p><p>'I remember seeing a note somewhere saying the fatality rate in Italy was 8 per cent because they had an elderly population, I thought 'well My God, we've got an elderly population.

And I think that that was creatively useful rather than the reverse.'</p><p>Mr Johnson suggested his 'male-dominated' team was behind aggressive private exchanges, saying that when he was London Mayor his office was gender balanced and 'very harmonious'. </p><p>'I think that the gender balance of my team should have been better,' he said.</p><p>'I think sometimes during the pandemic, too many meetings were too male-dominated if I'm absolutely honest with you.' </p><p>Mr Johnson also played down Mr Cummings' private calls for Matt Hancock to be sacked. 'If you're prime minister, you are constantly being lobbied by somebody to sack somebody else. It's just what, I'm afraid, happens and it's part of life,' he said.</p><p>He acknowledged Mr Cummings had a 'low opinion' of Mr Hancock but 'I thought he was wrong'.</p><p>'I stuck by the health secretary. I thought the health secretary worked very hard.'</p><p>He said Mr Hancock 'may have had defects' but 'I thought that he was doing his best in very difficult circumstances and I thought he was a good communicator'.</p><p>Mr Johnson said 'there were some really excellent cabinet discussions about the trade-offs' involved in curbing Covid.</p><p>But he claimed that the cabinet as a whole was 'more reluctant' to impose non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) than he was.</p><p>'That wasn't true for every member of the cabinet but that would be a general comment,' he added.</p><p>Mr Johnson revealed that he only read the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) minutes 'once or twice' during the crisis.</p><p>'I think I did once or twice look at the – maybe more than that – looked at what Sage had actually said and Sage certainly produced a lot of documentation,' he said.</p>"
