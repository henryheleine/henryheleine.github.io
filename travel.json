Yet a glance at Lineker’s social media outbursts suggest that ‘partisan campaigner’ is exactly what he is – yet he is still working at the Corporation on that enormous salary.</p><p>When the then-foreign secretary Liz Truss urged a boycott of the Champions League final in Russia in February last year, Lineker demanded: ‘And her party will hand back their donations from Russian donors?’</p><p>On that occasion, a BBC investigation prompted by a reader complaint ruled that he had breached impartiality rules but it made no difference to his employment – or his behaviour. Lineker simply carried on as if nothing had happened.</p><p>Last August he attacked Tory MPs, saying: ‘As a politician, how could you ever, under any circumstances, bring yourself to vote for pumping sewage into our seas. Unfathomable.’</p><p>He regularly takes to Twitter to offer his thoughts on the Middle East, attacking Israel’s treatment of Palestinians.

The road towards that can be really bumpy... it's called inner \"work\" for a reason.'  </p><p><b>INNER WORK:</b> 'With everything else around you, the only way you can combat [burnout] and build resilience for the outside world and your entire environment is the inner work... Outer work becomes so much easier when you get to grips with the inner work... If everybody [had time] to do [inner work], the shift in global consciousness and awareness would be enormous, it would be vast.'</p><p><b>DAILY MEDITATION:</b> 'I know that I need to meditate every day... Put it [into your daily routine] like brushing your teeth every morning... You need to put it into your day diary as a habit otherwise it's the first thing that drops away from your busy day.' </p><p><b>DAILY ME TIME:</b> 'I have now put in about half an hour, 45 minutes in the morning when one kid has gone to school and the other is having a nap, there's a break in our program. It's like, right, it's either for a workout, take the dog for a walk, get out in nature, maybe meditate. I would hope that everybody would be able to do that.'</p><p><b>LISTEN TO LESSONS FROM THE UNIVERSE:</b> 'Life is about learning and if you're in your 20s, your 30s, your 40s, and even your 50s and you think you've got it sorted then bad stuff is going to happen. But when bad thing happen I think, there's a lesson here, I'm being schooled by the universe, there is something for me to learn.'</p><p><b>TURN NEGATIVES INTO POSITIVES:</b> 'Every single bad thing - or the things you perceive to be bad - that happen actually can be good.' </p><p><b>SURROUND YOURSELF WITH MENTAL COACHES:</b> 'You need to have someone there who is not only coaching you through life but challenging your perspective. That's what I ask [my mental coach] for on a weekly basis... Professional help, friends, family, anyone can help you in that coaching process [and give you] the ability to be able to find somebody else to throw ideas off or feelings or thoughts.'</p><p><b>WIPE YOUR MENTAL WINDSCREEN:</b> 'Have different points of views in your life and friends who will not worry about pushing back on things you say or feel to be able to encourage you to be able to see it more clearly. I view that as trying to surround myself with people who will happily wash [my mental] windscreen and clear those filters... There is an endless filter system of what you think is happening.'</p><p><b>CREATE A MENTAL TOOL BOX:</b> 'I know how my nervous system is going to react to certain situations that are out of my control, [so I think], what have I got in my tool box? What tools can help me deal with this?'</p><p><b>HONE YOUR MENTAL SUPERPOWER:</b> 'Life is about discovery. In that discovery you are going to find things that you don't like, you're going to find things that make you uncomfortable, that are constantly pushing back on you but as you work your way around those things, all of a sudden the stresses, the chaos, and all of the things that were working against you in your life, be it private life, be it work life... all of the things getting in your way either fall away or you visualize them and are able to turn a negative into a positive and therefore make those things work for you. It almost feels like a superpower.'</p>"
