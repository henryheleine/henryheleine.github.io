But leaving the tax cut in place risked undermining the government's entire agenda. </p><p>A little after 10:30pm, Truss and her team arrived for a reception at The Cube restaurant, with its panoramic views of the city. The event had been arranged by the Conservative Home website – the bible of the Tory faithful – and was co-hosted by officers from the Tory party's 1922 committee. </p><p>The wine was flowing liberally, but Truss abstained. After she was introduced by 1922 chairman Sir Graham Brady, there were loud cheers when Truss cried: 'Frankly, we haven't made enough Conservative arguments for the past few years!' It was a bravura performance. Yet she knew the U-turn, to be announced imminently, was going to cost her. </p>"

Most were leading with gruelling headlines predicting a 'Tory revolt' over the tax plans. At least 36 Tory MPs, the number required to defeat the Government, were set to vote against. </p><p>The whips, who are in charge of party discipline, had failed to order backbenchers to toe the line on the tax cut in advance of conference. They were said to be 'blindsided' by the scale of the mounting rebellion. </p><p>As the final details of how to frame the surrender were being thrashed out in the PM's suite, the new party chairman Jake Berry, a 'Red Waller' who had warned Tory MPs they faced suspension if they voted against any of the Budget, was hosting a late-night drinks party nearby. </p><p>The chairman seemed on edge. His telephone would not stop ringing. It was clear to everyone present that something major was happening. The Daily Mail heard of the U-turn shortly before 10:30pm. The paper updated its front page to carry a new headline: Are Tories on brink of 45p tax U-turn? Our story highlighted the roles of Gove and Shapps in leading the revolt. </p><p>All told, it was an unholy political mess – and a disastrous day at conference. This morning, the Government moved to damage limitation. By dawn, Wendy Morton, the Chief Whip, was hastily ringing the Cabinet, with one minister telling me they were informed of the U-turn at 7am – just 25 minutes before the Chancellor himself confirmed it on Twitter. </p>"

'Anything you'd like to share with us, Chancellor?' I asked him. He smiled grimly, keeping his head down. </p><p>Last night, A senior Tory told me: 'The PM and Chancellor have used up a lot of goodwill. You have to remember: two-thirds of Tory MPs didn't vote for her. It's all very well her insisting there will be 'no Uturns' and making tough talk about difficult decisions, but she doesn't have the mandate.' </p><p>As for Truss, I'm told she is 'hurt' at having had to give up such a totemic tax change. As the thinktank boss Mark Littlewood said: 'I've known Liz Truss for many years, and I can't think of another time when she's changed her mind on anything, anything at all.' </p><p>Rishi Sunak, who Truss beat for the Tory leadership, has opted to stay away from the Tory conference, along with many Tory MPs. He will now be back in Parliament, quietly working on a renewed campaign for the Tory leadership. </p><p>The debacle of the past few days will confirm his view that his frontline political career is far from over.

the Government takes 20% of this.</p><p>Income between £50,271 and £150,000 falls into the Higher rate, which is taxed as 40%.</p><p>The Additional rate applies to all income over £150,000 and is taxed at 45%. </p><p>This does not include other taxes such as National Insurance. </p><p><b>What is the 45p rate of tax and who pays it?</b></p><p>The 45p rate of tax applies to people earning more than £150,000 a year.</p><p>It sees all income over £150,000 taxed at 45% - meaning that for every pound over this amount, the Treasury takes 45p. </p><p>It affects around 500,000 adults - around 1% of the population - and brings in around £6billion to the Treasury every year.</p><p>This would have essentially scrapped the Additional tax rate, making all income above £50,270 taxable at a flat rate of 40%.</p><p>The Chancellor argued the move would promote growth by allowing people to keep more of their money and encourage investment in the UK.</p><p><b>What does income tax cut mean for me?</b></p><p>For someone earning around £200,000 the tax cut would save them around £3,000.</p><p>This lead to accusations that it was a tax cut for the wealthiest at a time when the country is facing a cost of living crisis caused by rampant inflation and soaring energy bills.</p><p>The 45p tax cut would not have affected anyone earning less than £150,000 a year, which is around 99% of the population.</p><p>The drop in the Basic rate of tax from 20% to 19%, which has not been scrapped, will affect millions of households.</p><p>Someone earning £25,000 currently pays £2,486 in income tax - under the new rules this would drop to £2,361.70, a saving of just over £124.</p><p><b>Why have they performed the U-Turn?</b></p><p>After a barrage of criticism from opposition parties and their own MPs, the Prime Minister and Chancellor announced the tax cut would not go ahead this morning.</p><p>The furious reaction was augmented by the worried reaction of the markets, as the pound crashed and mortgage and interest rates shot up following the mini-budget.</p><p>The stock market plummeted as the traders were spooked by what they saw as unfunded tax cuts at a time when the Government announced it would be borrowing billions to freeze energy prices.</p><p>And in Parliament such was the anger at the proposals that there were suggestions that some Tory MPs could vote against the mini-budget when it is put to the House of Commons.</p><p>In a statement Mr Kwarteng said the furore over the abolition of the 45p tax rate was 'a massive distraction' from the rest of the mini-budget. </p><p>Speaking on morning television today, the Chancellor suggested he had decided to scrap the policy following the reaction and said he was doing so 'in a spirit of contrition and humility'.</p><p>He told LBC Radio that other parts of the growth package had been welcomed but 'there is this one element, which is the 45p rate, which was, I accept, controversial' and 'people have said they don't like it'.</p><p>'I'm listening, and I get it, and in a spirit of contrition and humility I have said 'actually this doesn't make sense, we won't go ahead with the abolition of the rate'.' </p>"

But this toxic stereotyping of women of Asian descent, it doesn't just end once the credits roll.' </p><p>In the introduction to today's episode, Meghan spoke of going to a Korean spa with her mother as a teenager, adding: 'It's a very humbling experience for a girl going through puberty because you enter a room with women from ages nine to maybe 90, all walking around naked and waiting to get a body scrub on one of these tables that are all lined up in a row.</p>"

It is the look of a man who is not daunted by what lies ahead – but rather is invigorated by it.</p><p>There is another significant factor here too. And it is a not-so-subtle nod to his wishes for a slimmed-down monarchy: one he believes will be more relevant and more resilient. Some will wonder if this is not just slimming down, but cutting to the bone. The unspoken elephant in the room is the absence of the King's younger son.</p><p>Three years ago, Prince Harry and his wife Meghan would have had every expectation to be part of this family ensemble.</p><p>Indeed, only four years ago, there was just such a photograph issued to mark the then-Prince of Wales's 70th birthday.</p><p>But, within months, the unity and happiness that radiated from that image had vanished.</p><p>So it is not difficult to imagine how this picture will be viewed in sunny California, where the Duke and Duchess of Sussex are based. Might it deepen their feelings of exclusion and exile, or will it merely serve to remind them why they chose to break from the family in the first place?</p><p>It surely can be no coincidence that the picture was taken when the couple were still in Britain and several days before they returned home to their children Archie and Lilibet. It must, therefore, be yet another signal that they will never again return to their central role in royal life.</p>"

It certainly feels like it.</p><p>Over the years the Queen often curated the photographs around her when she spoke to the nation for her Christmas message. She did so in 2019, when on her desk were pictures of her own father and Charles, but also William and Prince George. Here, it said, was monarchy past, present and future. The omission of Harry was said to have contributed to his break from the family just weeks later.</p><p>Rather than photographs, King Charles commandeered the art on the walls of his new palace home for this image – and he selected carefully.

Relations between the two households became quite tense.</p><p>The documentary had also shown not only Meghan's evident pain but also how far Harry and William had drifted apart.</p><p>Asked by Bradby about the rift between him and William, Harry had chosen not to deny it, but said instead: 'We are certainly on different paths at the moment . . . As brothers, you know, you have good days, you have bad days.'</p><p>William, home after the Pakistan tour, appears to have been taken aback at such a stark portrayal of his brother and sister-in-law's unhappiness. He realised they were in crisis.</p><p>The day after the documentary aired, William WhatsApped his brother to ask if he could come and see him. This put Harry and Meghan into a spin. What should they do?</p><p>Initially, Harry was in favour. Then he spoke to his brother again, and asked him whom he would tell.</p><p>William explained that he'd have to clear his schedule, which would mean telling his private secretary. At that point, Harry told him: Don't come.</p><p>He was so concerned that William's team would leak the visit to the Press that he would rather not see his brother than risk it getting into the papers. To everyone who knew what was going on, this was heartbreaking.</p><p>It highlighted the dysfunction at the heart of so many royal relationships, and how members of the Royal Family so rarely pick up the phone to speak to each other directly. Instead, they communicate via the apparatus around them. And the result is mistrust and division.</p><p>In her interview with Oprah Winfrey in March 2021, Meghan would discuss her mental fragility at greater length.</p><p>She talked about the pressure she'd felt from online abuse and the critical media coverage, pressure that she once described in a podcast as 'almost unsurvivable'. Watching her talk about her pain, and describe how she did not want to live any more, is an uncomfortable experience.</p><p>Most people would think such an expression of despair could be rooted only in truth. And yet a succession of decent people, all of whom had believed in Meghan and wanted to make her position work, came to be so disillusioned that they began to suspect that even her most heartfelt pleas for help were part of a deliberate strategy that had one end in sight — her departure. Perhaps, they say, nothing the palace could do was ever going to be good enough.</p><p>'She was looking for examples of us failing her from the beginning,' believes one former staffer. 'We were having to prove that the institution would bend over backwards to make her happy.</p><p>'It felt like that wasn't what she wanted, but that she wanted to be rejected.'</p>"

They left me with no choice but to leave.'</p><p>Some staff saw the problem as inextricably linked with the couple's fury about some of the press coverage, which they felt was sexist and even racist.</p><p>It also stung that Meghan had been dubbed Duchess Difficult because of the high staff turnover in their household.</p><p>As one source put it: 'The way I see it, their view of not getting institutional support was that they were not getting permission to blow up the [royal] institution's relationships with the media.'</p><p>Others suspected that, in the end, Meghan wanted to make money for herself. And the only way she could do that was by leaving behind her royal life in the UK and returning to America.</p><p>Too cynical? Perhaps. But the sad truth is that the relationships between Meghan and her advisers were in such a sorry state that this is what they genuinely believed.</p><p>Some argue that she never really wanted to be accepted by the Royal Family. That may be true.</p><p>But it's also true that if the institution had tried harder, and if she'd been more willing to adapt herself to palace life, she could have been one of the Royal Family's greatest assets.</p><p>The idea that she wanted to be rejected is challenged by her lawyers, Schillings.</p><p>Instead, they say she had a 'clear desire to fit in'.</p><p>'She left her country, career and life in North America to commit herself fully to her new role and made every effort to honour that commitment.'</p><p>If the danger signs were there from the beginning, so were the warnings.</p><p>The Sussexes' private secretary Sam Cohen told two key courtiers — the private secretaries to both Prince Charles and the Queen — that if it all went wrong with Harry and Meghan, the palace needed evidence of the duty of care the institution had shown them.</p><p>The 'duty of care' was crucial: '[Sam] was a broken record with them on that,' said a source.</p><p>By the time Meghan gave her interview to Oprah Winfrey, however, the palace had lost the argument over duty of care.</p><p>The duchess had hijacked the narrative by making it all about her mental health, which meant everything the palace had done to support the couple — including giving them a team who'd have done anything to help them succeed — was simply forgotten.</p><p>Instead, the duchess was able to point out all the times that the organisation had failed her.</p><p>One of them was when she went to the palace's head of HR in January 2019, saying she needed to get help with her mental health issues. She was given a sympathetic hearing but sent on her way, as was inevitable: HR is there to deal with employee issues, not members of the Royal Family.</p><p>Meghan would presumably have known that, so what was she doing there in the first place? Laying a trail of evidence would be the cynical answer. So desperate that she did not know where to turn would be the more charitable interpretation.</p><p>In the Oprah interview, Meghan also made the startling claim that she went to one of the 'most senior people,' saying she needed to go somewhere to get help — only to be told it wouldn't be 'good for the institution'.</p><p>It is a strange thought: would anyone really say that to a pregnant woman?</p><p>Until one hears from the other person in the room, it's difficult to know what to make of this.</p><p>However, the truth remains that Meghan appears to have been in a bad place. And Harry knew she was suffering.</p><p>Yet when Oprah asked why he didn't go to his own family to say his wife needed help, he said: 'I guess I was ashamed of admitting it to them.'</p><p>We can all understand such feelings of shame: mental health can be hard to talk about.</p><p>However, there is also something not quite right here.</p><p>Since 2016, Harry had devoted much of his energy to Heads Together, a campaign he had launched with William and Kate to try to persuade people to overcome the stigma surrounding mental health.</p><p>Years before, he'd decided to seek help himself after suffering his own mental crisis. Could he not have helped his wife do likewise?</p><p>And if he couldn't, he must have met scores of people through Heads Together who could have offered help and support. As one well-informed source said: 'He would have known exactly where to turn, who to call, what to do.'</p><p>Elsewhere in the Oprah interview, Meghan talked warmly of Julia Samuel, the psychotherapist who had been a friend of Princess Diana and remained close to Harry. She had, Meghan said, 'continued to be a friend and confidante'. Julia Samuel would also, presumably, have been an ideal person for the couple to go to for help.</p>"

All that gets turned over. I didn't see any of that any more.'</p><p>In the first six months of her marriage, there had been foreign holidays in Italy, Canada and Amsterdam, to say nothing of the couple's honeymoon. Then in 2019, Meghan visited Ibiza, France, Italy and New York (twice). It would have been a challenge to do all those trips without a passport.</p><p>I'm not going to go through every example in the interview of statements that are untrue, or misleading, such as her claim that they actually got married three days before their wedding. It's instructive, however, to look at one of Meghan's central claims: that the palace was not doing enough to stand up for her.</p><p>She told Oprah: 'Not only was I not being protected . . . they were willing to lie to protect other members of the family, but they weren't willing to tell the truth to protect me and my husband.'</p><p>The overriding issue that concerned her was a newspaper story about Kate crying after a bridesmaid's dress fitting for Princess Charlotte that took place before the wedding.</p><p>'The narrative with Kate — which didn't happen — was really, really difficult,' Meghan told Oprah.

Instead, she said, the reverse had happened.</p><p>'She was upset about something pertaining [to] flower-girl dresses, and it made me cry, and it really hurt my feelings.'</p><p>It was not an attractive performance: Meghan had spent months complaining about how her reputation had been smeared in the Press, and now she was doing the same to Kate, who quite clearly was never going to respond.</p><p>The story of Kate's tears was not the first time Meghan had tried to persuade the press office to brief journalists about an issue that was bothering her. The other concerned the departure of a member of staff, whose settlement deal contained a non-disclosure agreement.</p><p>Despite the employee being legally obliged to remain silent, the Sussexes — who say they didn't know about the non-disclosure agreement — repeatedly tried to get their communications secretary Jason Knauf to brief journalists about what Meghan saw as the reason behind the employee's departure.</p><p>Knauf refused, because he disagreed with Meghan's interpretation of events.

The characters have been criticised for 'sexually tokenising' Asian women, and at one stage Powers - a comedy spy who is portrayed as continually on the hunt for sexual conquests - is seen with a list reading 'threesome with Japanese twins'. </p><p>Meanwhile, Quentin Tarantino's 2003 cult hit Kill Bill sees Lucy Liu star as the murderously violent Yakuza leader O-Ren Ishii. The character was described by writer India Roby as a stereotypical Dragon Lady who 'uses her sexuality as a powerful tool of manipulation, but often is emotionally and sexually cold and threatens masculinity'. </p><p>Liu responded to the criticism last year in an opinion piece for The Washington Post, in which she argued that calling O-Ren a Dragon Lady doesn't make sense considering the film 'features three other female professional killers in addition to Ishii'. </p><p>Meghan began today's podcast by talking about her experience of growing up in <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/los-angeles/index.html\" id=\"mol-f365c580-43dd-11ed-b425-839e7e19537b\" class=\"class\">Los Angeles</a> which was 'full of culture that you could see, feel, hear and taste on a daily basis' and said she had a 'real love' of getting to know other cultures.</p>"

When she told him her name, he replies: 'Oh behave baby.'</p><p>'Movies like Austin Powers and Kill Bill presented these characters of Asian women as oftentimes over sexualized or aggressive,' Meghan says. 'And it's not just those two examples, there's so many more.'   </p><p>Expanding on the concept later in the podcast, the duchess told Cho: 'The Dragon Lady, the East Asian temptress whose mysterious foreign allure is scripted as both tantalising and deadly,' she told Cho. This has seeped into a lot of our entertainment. But this toxic stereotyping of women of Asian descent, it doesn't just end once the credits roll.' </p><p>In the introduction to today's episode, Meghan spoke of going to a Korean spa with her mother as a teenager, adding: 'It's a very humbling experience for a girl going through puberty because you enter a room with women from ages nine to maybe 90, all walking around naked and waiting to get a body scrub on one of these tables that are all lined up in a row.</p>"

Relations between the two households became quite tense.</p><p>The documentary had also shown not only Meghan's evident pain but also how far Harry and William had drifted apart.</p><p>Asked by Bradby about the rift between him and William, Harry had chosen not to deny it, but said instead: 'We are certainly on different paths at the moment . . . As brothers, you know, you have good days, you have bad days.'</p><p>William, home after the Pakistan tour, appears to have been taken aback at such a stark portrayal of his brother and sister-in-law's unhappiness. He realised they were in crisis.</p><p>The day after the documentary aired, William WhatsApped his brother to ask if he could come and see him. This put Harry and Meghan into a spin. What should they do?</p><p>Initially, Harry was in favour. Then he spoke to his brother again, and asked him whom he would tell.</p><p>William explained that he'd have to clear his schedule, which would mean telling his private secretary. At that point, Harry told him: Don't come.</p><p>He was so concerned that William's team would leak the visit to the Press that he would rather not see his brother than risk it getting into the papers. To everyone who knew what was going on, this was heartbreaking.</p><p>It highlighted the dysfunction at the heart of so many royal relationships, and how members of the Royal Family so rarely pick up the phone to speak to each other directly. Instead, they communicate via the apparatus around them. And the result is mistrust and division.</p><p>In her interview with Oprah Winfrey in March 2021, Meghan would discuss her mental fragility at greater length.</p><p>She talked about the pressure she'd felt from online abuse and the critical media coverage, pressure that she once described in a podcast as 'almost unsurvivable'. Watching her talk about her pain, and describe how she did not want to live any more, is an uncomfortable experience.</p><p>Most people would think such an expression of despair could be rooted only in truth. And yet a succession of decent people, all of whom had believed in Meghan and wanted to make her position work, came to be so disillusioned that they began to suspect that even her most heartfelt pleas for help were part of a deliberate strategy that had one end in sight — her departure. Perhaps, they say, nothing the palace could do was ever going to be good enough.</p><p>'She was looking for examples of us failing her from the beginning,' believes one former staffer. 'We were having to prove that the institution would bend over backwards to make her happy.</p><p>'It felt like that wasn't what she wanted, but that she wanted to be rejected.'</p>"

And the only way she could do that was by leaving behind her royal life in the UK and returning to America.</p><p>Too cynical? Perhaps. But the sad truth is that the relationships between Meghan and her advisers were in such a sorry state that this is what they genuinely believed.</p><p>Some argue that she never really wanted to be accepted by the Royal Family. That may be true.</p><p>But it's also true that if the institution had tried harder, and if she'd been more willing to adapt herself to palace life, she could have been one of the Royal Family's greatest assets.</p><p>The idea that she wanted to be rejected is challenged by her lawyers, Schillings.</p><p>Instead, they say she had a 'clear desire to fit in'.</p><p>'She left her country, career and life in North America to commit herself fully to her new role and made every effort to honour that commitment.'</p><p>If the danger signs were there from the beginning, so were the warnings.</p><p>The Sussexes' private secretary Sam Cohen told two key courtiers — the private secretaries to both Prince Charles and the Queen — that if it all went wrong with Harry and Meghan, the palace needed evidence of the duty of care the institution had shown them.</p><p>The 'duty of care' was crucial: '[Sam] was a broken record with them on that,' said a source.</p><p>By the time Meghan gave her interview to Oprah Winfrey, however, the palace had lost the argument over duty of care.</p><p>The duchess had hijacked the narrative by making it all about her mental health, which meant everything the palace had done to support the couple — including giving them a team who'd have done anything to help them succeed — was simply forgotten.</p><p>Instead, the duchess was able to point out all the times that the organisation had failed her.</p><p>One of them was when she went to the palace's head of HR in January 2019, saying she needed to get help with her mental health issues. She was given a sympathetic hearing but sent on her way, as was inevitable: HR is there to deal with employee issues, not members of the Royal Family.</p><p>Meghan would presumably have known that, so what was she doing there in the first place? Laying a trail of evidence would be the cynical answer. So desperate that she did not know where to turn would be the more charitable interpretation.</p><p>In the Oprah interview, Meghan also made the startling claim that she went to one of the 'most senior people,' saying she needed to go somewhere to get help — only to be told it wouldn't be 'good for the institution'.</p><p>It is a strange thought: would anyone really say that to a pregnant woman?</p><p>Until one hears from the other person in the room, it's difficult to know what to make of this.</p><p>However, the truth remains that Meghan appears to have been in a bad place. And Harry knew she was suffering.</p><p>Yet when Oprah asked why he didn't go to his own family to say his wife needed help, he said: 'I guess I was ashamed of admitting it to them.'</p><p>We can all understand such feelings of shame: mental health can be hard to talk about.</p><p>However, there is also something not quite right here.</p><p>Since 2016, Harry had devoted much of his energy to Heads Together, a campaign he had launched with William and Kate to try to persuade people to overcome the stigma surrounding mental health.</p><p>Years before, he'd decided to seek help himself after suffering his own mental crisis. Could he not have helped his wife do likewise?</p><p>And if he couldn't, he must have met scores of people through Heads Together who could have offered help and support. As one well-informed source said: 'He would have known exactly where to turn, who to call, what to do.'</p><p>Elsewhere in the Oprah interview, Meghan talked warmly of Julia Samuel, the psychotherapist who had been a friend of Princess Diana and remained close to Harry. She had, Meghan said, 'continued to be a friend and confidante'. Julia Samuel would also, presumably, have been an ideal person for the couple to go to for help.</p>"

There was no way to reach an agreement on that point.</p><p>There is one final thought on this, from a surprising source: perhaps the Sussexes' departure from the country and the Royal Family was not the untrammelled disaster so many think it was.</p><p>One courtier, who knows Harry and remains upset about what he and Meghan did, said: 'Part of me thinks Meghan did Harry the greatest kindness anyone could do, which was to take him out of the Royal Family, because he was desperately unhappy in the last couple of years of his working life.</p><p>'We knew he was unhappy, but we didn't really know what the solution would be.
