They’ve realised they don’t need to invite people they haven’t seen for years. It can just be the two of them.’</p><p>Like Kathy at Ocean Kave, when she first started in 2013, Caroline has slashed the number of guests from 150 to a maxim of 24. Elopements, with just the bride and groom, have risen from a quarter of their business in 2018 to almost half last year.</p>"

					"content": "<p>‘It’s going up and up and up,’ Caroline says. ‘Since Christmas to now, 52 per cent of our enquiries have been about elopements. Enquiries for big weddings are 14 per cent so far.’</p><p>They introduced four elopement packages in an attempt to ‘Covid proof the business’.</p><p>Their cheapest package, aptly named ‘The Runaways’, includes a two-hour morning ceremony and costs from £1,800.</p><p>‘It’s not our most popular though,’ Caroline says. ‘That’s our The Adventurers package for £2,550 in which we allow more time for couples to explore our part of the Lake District including Rydal Water and Rydal Caves in which The Witcher was filmed.'</p><p>Couples elope for all manner of reasons, she adds. ‘One older couple had been together for 42 years but had decided to do our two-hour elopement package,’ Caroline says. </p><p>‘They just wanted to be married with little fuss. But we also get younger people who want to be married but are more budget conscious. A lot of the time, it’s the parents of the couple who want the big wedding and, often, they’re holding the purse strings.’</p><p>Gavin Richards couldn’t bear the thought of having another big, white wedding when he married his second wife, Holly, last June.</p><p>‘My first wedding for around 100 guests was full of people I didn’t really know that I had to speak to,’ Gavin, 43, says. ‘It was really stressful and a performance. You had to stand up and do speeches and all the other traditional things. I didn’t want the same thing with Holly.'</p>"

					"content": "<p>The couple, from Caldicot, South Wales, decided to elope, spending £3,500 at small wedding specialist, Frieda and the Moon near Looe in Cornwall where, post pandemic, elopements have risen to 70 per cent of their business.</p><p>'We thought elopement meant running away to get married and not telling anybody. It’s not like that at all,’ Gavin adds.</p><p>‘We told everybody what we were doing. My family were very supportive, and my dad was relieved - I can’t imagine any bloke really wants to go to a wedding.’</p><p>Specialist hairdresser Holly, 34, felt similarly. ‘If I’d had a big wedding, some family members wouldn’t have been able to make it. Some are poorly but some, well, it’s easier if they’re not in the same room. </p><p>'I wanted our wedding to be romantic and my idea of romance is not spending it with my family and friends. I also hate being the centre of attention.’</p><p>‘It was all very relaxed,’ Gavin, a graphic designer, adds. ‘We had a cabin, which was completely off grid with chickens wandering around. </p><p>'On the day of the wedding, we spent the morning in the hot tub before getting ready together. Paul and Babs, the venue’s owners, acted as our witnesses and even took pictures afterwards of us with a couple of friendly sheep. </p><p>'Afterwards, we ate sandwiches, drank champagne, went for a walk in the woods and had a nap. It just felt right. I don’t know why everybody isn’t doing it.’</p><p>Cornwall based wedding photographer Thomas Frost has seen elopements rise from 50 to 70 per cent of his business.</p><p>‘Bookings for big weddings have so far been slow,’ he says. ‘I’ve had to delete guests from photographs I’ve done at big weddings because they’ve fallen out with the bride and groom. You don’t get any of that at elopements. </p><p>'There’s no pressure to take those traditional family group pictures. I take couples up over the cliffs, clambering over rocks and jumping over ravines. It makes it more memorable. </p><p>'Another trend is for a couple to elope and then have a big party six months down the line at which they show their wedding photos and video.’</p><p>A wedding cake maker in the West Country has also seen a rise. ‘Since Covid, cakes for elopement weddings have become almost 50 per cent of my business,’ says Emma Smith, co-owner of Mrs Smudgers Kitchen. </p><p>'‘Before it was more like 20 per cent. The pandemic has allowed couples to do their own thing. People can also have less traditional cakes when they elope. </p><p>'We made a dung beetle cake for a pair of scientists who study the insects. It featured a fondant dung beetle burrowing into layers of cake. </p><p>'One bride had a unicorn cake and another was covered in sweets for the couple’s grandchildren. The cakes tend to be a lot smaller: the smallest one we’ve done is 4” across.</p><p>‘When we first started there was a definite wedding season but now, with elopements, it’s all year round and every day of the week.’</p><p>Another advantage of elopement weddings is they can be booked as little as two months ahead, says Bob Boothby, co-owner of Millbrook Estate in North Devon where wedding packages start from just £999.</p><p>‘Last year, at least seven of our weddings happened within 35 days of the booking,’ he says.</p><p>Bob’s luxury treehouse venue can accommodate up to 14 guests but 60 per cent of the weddings held there are now couple only.</p><p>‘In the last year we’ve noticed luxury elopements rocket in popularity,’ Bob says. ‘Covid has taken it to a different level. It’s given people an excuse to do their wedding their way.'</p><p>Bob often acts as a witness during the elopements and has seen it all. ‘We’ve had a couple who got married and were in the hot tub with a bottle of champagne 30 minutes later. Another couple wanted some au naturel photographs in our bluebell woods.</p><p>‘Some of the readings are so raw,’ he adds. ‘One woman talked about their really rocky relationship, mentioning how much of a naughty boy he’d been. </p><p>'We’ve had couples in wellies, shorts, jeans and T-shirts. 20 per cent of couples bring their dog, some of whom act as ring bearer. </p><p>‘People have brought their cats, one couple brought their two rabbits and we just had an enquiry about someone who wants to bring their ferrets. We like to say yes where we can.’</p><p>But not everyone is always so happy.</p><p>‘We’ve had mother in laws on the phone demanding to know where their son is getting married,’ Bob says. ‘One phoned up recently and tried to book accommodation so she could surprise her daughter in law. </p><p>'When I phoned up the bride to tell her, she couldn’t believe it. At another wedding, which was kept a secret, a family member found out and drove all the way from the north. They even phoned for directions, which was quite awkward. It’s happened about 20 times since we started but since Covid hit, we’re getting less of those calls.’</p><p>Indeed, when Sian and Emma broke the news that their big, white wedding was off and they were eloping instead, Sian’s mother didn’t take it well.</p><p>‘I’m her only child so she was upset and has tried to find any way to be there, even offering to pay for herself to be at the elopement,’ Sian says.</p><p>‘My best friend was also upset,’ Emma adds. ‘We did feel a lot of guilt about cancelling our big wedding but then we agreed it was our day and eloping is what we want. </p><p>'People still feel the pressure from family to have a big wedding, but it doesn’t have to be that way. Knowing we’re going to have our special day together, just us, is frankly a relief.'</p>"

He said he was four or five years old when his parents were killed by the Taliban in the Laghman province in the east of the country.</p><p><b>Oct 2015</b> Having been tortured by the Taliban and left for dead at the side of the road, Abdulrahimzai is smuggled out of Afghanistan through Pakistan by a man described as his ‘uncle’. He has his fingerprints taken in Serbia, and then a few weeks later in Norway. Jul 2016 Abdulrahimzai, using one of his many fake names, has his fingerprints taken in the northeastern port city of Trieste, Italy.</p><p><b>Feb 2017</b> He is convicted of two drug offences in Italy and handed a suspended sentence. Jun 2017 Abdulrahimzai is back in Serbia.</p><p><b>Jul 31 to Aug 1, 2018</b> Abdulrahimzai guns down two fellow Afghans with an assault rifle at a shed near a motorway in Dobrinci in an apparent argument about people smuggling. He flees in a taxi. He is declared a wanted man by Serbian authorities. Oct 2018 Abdulrahimzai is back in Norway. Nov 2019 He applies for asylum in Norway, but is refused.</p><p><b>Dec 26 2019</b> Weeks later, Abdulrahimzai travels as an unaccompanied passenger on a Brittany Ferries service from Cherbourg in France to Poole in Dorset. Upon arrival, he tells officials he is 14.</p><p><b>Jan 2, 2020</b> He is placed into the foster care of Nicola Marchant-Jones, an experienced foster carer in Bournemouth. Adbulrahimzai, who is initially unable to speak English, later begins attending school locally. Nov 2020 Abdulrahimzai goes on trial, in his absence, in Serbia for the double-murder. He is convicted and sentenced to 20 years in jail.</p><p><b>Dec 2020</b> Ms Marchant-Jones raises the alarm with social services, who contact police, after she spots Abdulrahimzai with a knife during a shopping trip. He is spoken to, but not arrested.</p><p><b>Aug 2021</b> Abdulrahimzai has an argument with his fostermother and leaves the home. He is later placed with another family. Mar 10, 2022 Dorset Police receive a report that he is carrying a knife. No weapon is found, however, and no arrests are made.</p><p><b>Mar 12, 2022</b> Abdulrahimzai headbutts a man during a row outside a nightclub in Bournemouth. Moments later, he gets into an argument with 24-year-old James Medway over an e-scooter. Thomas Roberts, 21, acts as ‘peacekeeper’ but is then stabbed twice by Abdulrahimzai. The incident lasts less than half a minute. The killer escapes on foot. Mr Roberts dies later in hospital.</p><p><b>Mar 13, 2022</b> Abdulrahimzai is arrested after accidentally leaving his phone at the scene. He tells officers he is 16 years old.</p><p><b>Jan 23 2023</b> Abdulrahimzai, determined by a court to be 21, is convicted of murdering Mr Roberts by jurors in Salisbury.</p>"
