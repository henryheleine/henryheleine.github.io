For example, during periods of unemployment or years bringing up children you can build up credits towards the pension without making NI contributions.</p><p>Some credits can be backdated for many years, such as the 'grandparent credit'. This is where a parent receiving child benefit is paying NI and is able to work because another family member is looking after a child under 12.</p><p>This does not need to be full-time care but could include, for example, dropping off at school or cover during school holidays.</p><p>However, there are limits on other credits, including those associated with child benefit which can only be backdated three months. Failing to claim at the time of caring for children will lead to permanent damage to your NI record. It means you may still have to pay to fill the gaps.</p><p>The main way most people boost their state pension is by filling in gaps for specific years for which they didn't make NI contributions (or didn't pay enough NI to clock up any entitlement).</p>"

This is the rate for Class 3 contributions, the most common type paid by workers.</p><p>Those who are self-employed typically pay at the Class 2 rate, which is much lower than for employees — currently £163.80 a year. This means it costs much less to fill in gaps in a record but generates the same boost in the state pension.</p><p>On average, 123,000 people pay to boost their state pension every year, according to a freedom of information request by wealth manager Quilter. More than 600,000 people have done so since the flat rate system was introduced in 2016.

It simply won't increase your payout and will be money down the drain.</p><p>The same applies if you've already got 35 years of full NI contributions — any gaps do not need filling as they won't boost your payout. </p><p>That's why it's so vital you check your entitlement and speak to the experts before acting.</p><p>There are also some circumstances where you may not be able to plug the gap for missing contributions. For example, if you were 'contracted out' during those years.</p><p>Millions of people have spent at least a year paying into a 'contracted out' pension, which is meant to replace part of their state pension. </p><p>Those who were contracted out by their employer paid less in NI contributions that year — and the money instead went into a company pension.</p><p>As a result, they are on track to receive a smaller sum from the state, but a larger sum from their workplace pensions. </p><p>Overall, they should be no worse off. In fact, some may be much better off thanks to the growth of their company pension plans over time. Contracting out ended in 2016.</p><p>Crucially, making extra voluntary NI payments for years during which you were contracted out will have no effect on your state pension. It is impossible to boost the amount you receive to the full flat rate. </p><p>Some people have lost large sums of money by trying to do this. Whatever you do, do not make the same mistake!</p><p>To find out whether you were contracted out at any point, you can check old payslips or ask your pension provider.</p><p>On old payslips, if the NI contribution line has the letter 'D' or 'N' next to it, that means you were contracted out. The letter 'A' means you fully paid your contribution for that year.</p><p>Those who worked in the public sector and saved towards a 'defined benefit' pension, which provides guaranteed income in retirement, are more likely to have been contracted out.</p><p>You will also be able to tell if you have been contracted out if your state pension forecast includes a 'Contracted-out Pension Equivalent', also known as COPE.</p><p>This indicates how much will be deducted from your income as a result of being contracted out.</p><p>j.beard@dailymail.co.uk</p>"

(2016) </p><p class=\"mol-para-with-font\">Since publishing Riders in 1985, best-selling author Jilly Cooper has written 21 romance novels, including ten in the Rutshire series. The tenth, Mount!, marked the muchheralded return of philanderer Rupert Campbell-Black, still just as swoonsome at 59. </p><p class=\"mol-para-with-font\">C — E.L. James - Fifty Shades Of Grey (2011) </p><p class=\"mol-para-with-font\">E.L. James, real name Erika Mitchell, breathed new life into the erotic novel genre with her Fifty Shades trilogy.

Her sex scenes made headlines after a Twitter account, @DailyDorries, started sharing them online and racked up several thousand rapt fans. </p><p class=\"mol-para-with-font\">H — Richard E. Grant - By Design (1998) </p><p class=\"mol-para-with-font\">Oscar-nominated actor Richard E.

This rather clumsy scene involving Cherie, by then his wife of 14 years, saw him nominated for a Bad Sex award in its year of publication. </p><p class=\"mol-para-with-font\">J — Simon Sebag Montefiore - Sashenka (2008) </p><p class=\"mol-para-with-font\">Set in 20th-century Russia, Sashenka tells the tale of a loyal Communist wife who embarks on an illicit affair.
