Auroras display dynamic patterns of brilliant lights that appear as curtains, rays, spirals, or dynamic flickers covering the entire sky.</p><p>According to Clark (2007), there are four main forms that can be seen from the ground, from least to most visible</p><p>· A mild glow, near the horizon. These can be close to the limit of visibility, but can be distinguished from moonlit clouds because stars can be seen undiminished through the glow.</p><p>· Patches or surfaces that look like clouds.</p><p>· Arcs curve across the sky.</p><p>· Rays are light and dark stripes across arcs, reaching upwards by various amounts.</p><p>· Coronas cover much of the sky and diverge from one point on it.</p><p>Brekke (1994) also described some auroras as curtains. The similarity to curtains is often enhanced by folds within the arcs. Arcs can fragment or break up into separate, at times rapidly changing, often rayed features that may fill the whole sky. These are also known as discrete auroras, which are at times bright enough to read a newspaper by at night</p><p>These forms are consistent with auroras being shaped by Earth's magnetic field. The appearances of arcs, rays, curtains, and coronas are determined by the shapes of the luminous parts of the atmosphere and a viewer's position.</p>"

It is the Coronation that connects us to the very beginning of our existence as a nation state.</p><p>Handel’s anthem Zadok The Priest, composed for George II’s Coronation in 1727 and sung at crownings ever since, is a reminder of the thread of history stitched into this extraordinary ceremony.</p><p>The words, taken from the Biblical passage describing the anointing of King Solomon, have been used at every Coronation since the Anglo-Saxon King Edgar was crowned in Bath in 973: ‘And all the people rejoiced and said, God save the King! Long live the King! God save the King! May the King live for ever. Amen. Hallelujah.’</p><p>The plans appear to have been made in view of the cost of living crunch millions are facing.</p><p>Yet I am not at all sure that a cut-down, updated version is what the country actually wants.</p><p>Perhaps the King and his advisers should reflect on the lessons to be learned from the solemn, moving yet magnificent spectacle that we witnessed only last month.</p><p>There was nothing ‘slimmed down’ about the Queen’s funeral. You can’t really do these things by halves.</p><p>It was, quite rightly, judged by the world to have been a fitting farewell to a universally admired monarch. The nation was thrilled by a breathtaking display, laid on to express our love and gratitude to our beloved Sovereign – gratitude that she had earned by a lifetime of devoted service.</p><p>If ever there was a time and a place for pomp, this was it. For ten days, we marvelled at a sequence of splendid ceremonies, beginning in Scotland followed by the lying-in-state and culminating in the obsequies at Westminster Abbey and St George’s Chapel. The day of the funeral was full of moments that will live in our memories for ever.</p><p>Who could forget the pallbearers, as they carried the mortal remains of their Commander-in-Chief out of Westminster Hall, to be greeted by the King, his family and the gun carriage drawn by naval ratings?</p>"

It had been carefully planned and rehearsed for years.</p><p>The late Queen herself was intimately involved. It was her decision to hold the funeral in Westminster Abbey rather than St George’s Chapel in Windsor, so that as many people as possible could attend.</p><p>This was a break with precedent: no royal funeral had taken place at the Abbey since the 18th century. No doubt some officials disapproved, tut-tutting about the cost or fretting about security.</p><p>Yet it was unquestionably the right decision. With her unerring instinct for the public mood, Her Majesty knew what the nation, Commonwealth and the world expected.</p><p>And she was as aware as anyone that the monarchy brings in so much more than it costs in terms of soft power, prestige and tourism.</p><p>So it should be with the Coronation of King Charles. I am glad he has let it be known that he will be crowned as defender of the faith, not defender of faith.</p><p>It is a Christian ceremony and must reflect the liturgy and beliefs of the Church of England, of which the King is the Supreme Governor. I am glad that we have a Church established by law in this realm, even though I myself, as a Roman Catholic, do not belong to it.</p><p>The leaders of other faiths recognise their freedoms and rights are better protected in this Christian country than in an atheist one.</p><p>The great and much lamented former Chief Rabbi, Jonathan Sacks, told me he was grateful to live in a land where the Anglican faith was primus inter pares (first among equals). He feared a militantly secular Britain would be less tolerant and Jews in particular might feel less at home here.</p><p>It is understandable that the King wants his Coronation to reflect the more diverse country we have become in the past 70 years.</p><p>But he should beware of ‘woke’ attempts to change the ceremony to accommodate those of all faiths and none. There’s a danger that Charles risks making himself somehow less authoritative if he’s not going to be presented to the world as a full-on monarch.</p><p>To think otherwise is just self-defeating virtue-signalling.</p><p>Similarly, Charles should not worry too much about the cost, at a time of concern about rising inflation, taxes and mortgages.</p><p>That cost is a drop in the ocean of public spending. Those involved in the ceremonials will count it an honour and most of it won’t cost the taxpayer a penny. This is the ultimate public occasion. It has nothing to do with private extravagance by a few royals, some of whom may be open to criticism.</p><p>Only a rump of embittered anti-monarchists will begrudge us the pomp and circumstance the British do better than anyone else on Earth. So my message to His Majesty is: pull out all the stops, Sir.</p><p>Let the nation enjoy a day of joyful celebration at the crowning of our new King.</p>"

In 1952, it was reported that ‘an ingot or wedge of gold of a pound weight’ was presented to the monarch by the Lord Great Chamberlain before being placed upon the altar. A source said: ‘In an age where people are feeling the pinch, this is not going to happen.’</p><p>Velvet chairs made especially for the 1953 Coronation are likely to be replaced by standard seating.</p><p>Diplomats and other male guests invited to the 1953 Coronation were instructed that ‘knee breeches’ were in order, while women were advised to wear headgear, preferably tiaras.</p><p>The dress code next year will be less prescriptive.</p><p>Discussions had taken place on relaxing the requirement for peers to wear so-called coronation robes. A cloak of crimson velvet, the rank of the peer is indicated by rows of ermine – a stoat’s white winter fur and black tail end – on the cape. Lieutenant Colonel Anthony Mather, who started the plan for King Charles’s Coronation – which has since been updated – told The Mail on Sunday: ‘No Coronation robes. Give them to a museum where they belong. It’s not going to be a tweed jacket and pair of jeans – but morning suit or lounge suit.’</p><p>Other experts speculated that peers could don their ermine-trimmed parliamentary robes instead.</p><p>Outlining how the guest list will be reduced, Lt Col Mather added: ‘‘There are about 700 peers, well they won’t all be there,’ he said. ‘The same with MPs: they won’t all be present because he’s not being crowned for them. He’s being crowned for the people.’</p><p>Seventy years ago, Prince Philip was instrumental in chairing the Privy Council Coronation Committee that oversaw many of the ceremonial arrangements for the big day.</p><p>A great moderniser, he agreed that the service should be televised. This time, as heir to the throne, Prince William is expected to play an important role on the committee.</p><p>Meanwhile, as The Mail on Sunday revealed in February, Camilla will be crowned Queen Consort alongside her husband.</p><p>The Duke of Norfolk declined to comment.</p><h2>Meet the Queen Consort: Royal Family shares series of photos highlighting the life and work of Camilla - from her love of rescue dogs to her charity involvement, and her endorsement from the Queen</h2><h2><b>By Vanessa Allen and Rebecca English Royal Editor for the Daily Mail </b></h2>"

As well as grassy or even smoky aromas, you should detect some peppery, fresh and fruity notes from the polyphenols: if good quality, it sometimes makes you cough. Buying from small producers who are involved in the process from plant to bottle is also a good way of ensuring quality. </p><p><b>IGNORE ‘HYPE’ BERRIES </b></p><p>Wellness websites confidently declare acai (pronounced ‘a- say-ehh’) berries as good for the heart and for helping impotence and inflammation as well as being anti-ageing, immune-boosting and good for skin health and weight loss. </p><p>It is widely claimed they contain several-fold more antioxidants than blueberries. This is all based on wishful thinking — not data. </p><p>For one serving of dried acai berries you could buy ten bowls of fresh seasonal or frozen blueberries, each with the same or better nutritional value, and the bonus of some clinical evidence and smaller carbon footprint. </p><p>Similarly, Goji berries may have good polyphenol content but they are touted as boosting the immune system and brain activity, protecting against heart disease and cancer, and improving life expectancy — all claims, again, based on thin air and dubious studies, mostly funded by goji juice companies. </p><p><b>SOURDOUGH SWAP </b></p><p>With all the advantages of high fibre, long fermentation time and natural ingredients, eating something containing sourdough should logically be great for your health and gut microbes. Most coeliacs would be horrified at the thought of trying wheat bread again, but some small Italian studies have found that four out of six sufferers could tolerate longfermented sourdough bread. </p><p>That’s because microbes in sourdough help degrade the gluten into smaller fragments than in normal bread, making the protein easier to digest. </p><p>A whole matrix of micro organisms is present in any natural sourdough starter, including acid-loving bacteria and fungi that break down fibres, feast on sugars, produce healthy metabolites and enhance the vitamin content found in the grain itself. </p><p>But be warned: many commercial sourdough brands add several chemicals including commercial yeasts to speed up the process, as well as flavourings or small amounts of lactic acid or sourdough flour to give it that fake sour tang, and emulsifiers and fats. Buying hand-made from a baker or making your own is the best choice. </p><p><b>TRY OUT SAUERKRAUT </b></p><p>Many so - called probiotic sauerkrauts are pickled in vinegar to give them a better shelf life, which kills all the microbes (­rendering this no healthier than pickled onions). Better to make your own. </p><p><b>THE PERFECT PEAR </b></p>"

Often so little taste remains after purifying that key minerals have to be replaced, which means that although most still lack the extensive range of elements found in tap water they still contain many of the disinfectants and chemicals people are keen to avoid. By definition, ‘spring water’ has to come from defined natural sources and ‘mineral water’ has to come from a source and to also contain a minimum mineral or electrolyte content. Italian San Pellegrino and French Badoit contain enough calcium (more than 160mg) to help avoid calcium deficiency.</p><p><b>LIMIT PROCESSED FOODS </b></p><p>Most people think of Quorn as being made from a friendly mushroom-like plant, but it is actually made from mould called ‘mycoprotein’, first grown in a lab in the 1970s through a collaboration between giant UK food company, Rank Hovis McDougall, and Imperial Chemical Industries. Scientists picked the Fusarium venenatum mould, discovered in English soil, because it had a very high protein content with tendrils that resembled the size and texture of meat fibres. </p><p>Quorn is grown in vast quantities in 230-tonne vats of broth and usually mixed with dried egg whites or potato starch (for vegans) to bind it before adding flavourings and firming agents. </p><p>This makes it an ultra-processed food (UPF) and it’s not a good idea to allow UPFs to form a staple part of your diet.</p><p><b>A PINCH OF POSH SALT </b></p><p>Sea salt is a billion-dollar global business, and some salts have a 5,000 per cent mark-up compared with table salt. </p><p>The most expensive is Korean bamboo salt, a delicacy at around £50 for a tiny 2oz jar, made by progressively heating up grey sea salt in a sealed bamboo stick coated with clay until it becomes molten and recrystallises. </p><p>Kosher or kitchen salt, preferred by chefs, is a purer form of table salt without additives and with larger irregular granules, so a pinch is a third less concentrated (and salty) than table salt. </p><p>Salt really is best added from a height (and a flourish) to the pot or food, so it disperses evenly. </p><p>Sea salt, if unrefined, has a much wider surface area and irregular crystal structure. It contains several minerals, including calcium, iodine and magnesium, and can contain algae. It is good for adding to plated food where these subtle differences can be picked up by the tongue but it is wasted when added to the pot. </p><p><b>SAY NO TO FAKE FRUIT </b></p><p>Many breakfast cereals claim to contain healthy ‘natural’ dried fruit pieces, but don’t be fooled. Manufacturers of cheap processed cereals, granola, cereal bars, muffins and biscuits use combinations of sugar, corn syrup, gelatine, starch, oil and artificial ‘berry’ flavours and dyes to create their own mock fruit flavoured product. </p><ul><li class=\"mol-style-bold\">Adapted by Louise Atkinson from Food For Life: The New Science Of Eating Well by Professor Tim Spector (£20, Vintage Publishing), to be published on October 27. </li></ul>"

It’s like a reservoir of bad feelings, getting fuller, until all it takes is one jostle and the whole thing comes crashing down. </p><p>But all of this can be headed off by doing this simple thing: ask for what you need. </p><p><b>Today’s assignment: </b></p><p><b>Step one:</b> Reflect. What do you need or want? Think about what you’ve been wanting from your partner. Are you longing to spend more time with them? Do you need help with housework? Do you need to feel more supported in pursuing your career? Do you need to hear ‘I love you’ more often? </p><p><b>Step two: </b>Describe yourself. Always ask for what you need by talking about how you feel. </p><p>‘I miss you. Can we spend time together tonight, no phones and no TV?’ </p><p>‘I am swamped this week. Could you take something off my plate?’ </p><p>‘I’m feeling so tired today. Would you do dinner, so I can rest for a few minutes?’ </p><p>‘I love being held by you. Give me a hug.’ </p><p><b>SATURDAY </b></p><p><b>Practise the mini touch </b></p>"

The plan was that Leona would go to her pal's house on a sleepover.</p><p>'They went in to get an ice cream.
