Colbert has said in interviews that although he was raised in a devout family, his intellectual parents taught him to be questioning of the Church, a theme which continues to run through his comic routines. Although he would later teach Sunday school.</p><p>In 1974, when he was ten, Stephen's father and two of his brothers Peter and Paul were killed in a plane crash in North Carolina. The tragedy and the family's subsequent move to an urban area of Charleston led to him becoming an introverted teenager with few friends who relied on the worlds of science-fiction and fantasy. Colbert credits his love of the role-playing game Dungeons and Dragons for sparking an early interest in acting.</p><p>By his own admission a slacker in the academic department, he swayed over whether he would attend college. He had a brief stint in a Rolling Stones cover band and saw his dreams of becoming a marine biologist shattered after surgery left him deaf in his right ear. He studied philosophy at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia then transferred to Northwestern as a theater major.</p><p>After college, he wound up in an improvised comedy troupe in Chicago where he understudied Steve Carrell and met Amy Sedaris and Paul Dinello. The trio were offered the chance to do an HBO series which earned positive reviews. The opportunity led to brief writing stints for SNL, MTV and GMA, before he was hired on a trial basis for the Daily Show in 1997.</p><p>He later admitted that he took Xanax for years to deal with anxiety, and said: 'I had thrown my life away by attempting to do something that so few people actually get away with, or succeed at.'</p><p>Colbert satirized a news correspondent with little more than a basic grip of the subject he was discussing. His writing on the Daily Show earned him three Emmys.</p><p>In 2005, his news satire spin-off The Colbert Report launched on Comedy Central. It started with high-ratings and has held its place as one of the network's most-watched shows.</p><p>On April 10 2014, it was announced that Colbert would be filling the shoes of David Letterman on The Late Show.</p><p>He lives in Montclair, New Jersey with his wife Evelyn and three children Madeleine, Peter and John.</p>"
