A proper backup solution some mean the most you lose is, at maximum, a days work and a full restore shouldn't take more than an hour. So the clerk made a mistake, we all can do that. The IT system should be robust enough to deal with any problem like this. At my last firm, I went on incessantly about this to the point where they did install a full backup system. Only a fortnight later, a workman disconnected a mains supply that took out the main server cooling system and all four raid drives failed at once. Total wipeout of ALL the firms data, except we had a backup. Bullet dodged. "
